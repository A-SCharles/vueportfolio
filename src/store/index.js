      about: "I am an honest, hard-working, punctual, reliable, patient and confident person with good leadership skills. I am also a good team player.I studied IT at College of Cape-Town for 3 years, I completed the course in 2021, I have a responsive web design certification which can be viewed here. Prior to my IT NCV level 4 certification, I completed the memorization of the Qur'an after 4 years at Madrasatun'Nur, I also have a Level 2 mechanical engineering certification. At a young age I've always been passionate about breaking things and putting them back together, I do not know why, It was just exciting to me. When I first started, I had no idea how to program or do anything technical, but because of my excellent teachers I slowly started to learn how to do it, I became good at it and began to develop a passion for it. Now I find myself eager to learn more about the vast world of Software Development. While studying IT at the College of Cape Town, I found my passion for the tech industry.",
